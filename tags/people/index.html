<p>I am Shirley Hendrikse, Head of Education at STRP in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. Since 2006, STRP explores the relationshop between art, technology, and societal issues with artists, designers, media makers, thinkers, and its audience.</p>
<h4 id="how-would-you-define-mediating-media-arts--media-art-mediation-what-specific-issues-and-concerns-do-you-have-in-the-field-of-education-and-technology">How would you define mediating media arts / media art mediation? What specific issues and concerns do you have in the field of education and technology?</h4>
<p>For us, media art mediation is the engagement of specific target groups in the field of media art, or, as STRP refers to, Art &amp; Technology.</p>
<p>Technology, including digital media, has become inseparable from our daily lives, and we must relate to it. By connecting art and technology, we can make what seems complicated or what will arise in the future tangible and understandable. After all, artists are specialists in letting us experience the unusual and new.</p>
<p>Technological developments are moving faster and faster and are overwhelming. Perhaps so overwhelming that we can only watch and let it overcomee us. It is within STRP&rsquo;s core belief that engaging young people in these developments is essential. This future generation should have a major stake in the dialogue about where we are going and want to go.
Educational Art &amp; Technology programmes can establish this engagement.
But currently, this relatively new art discipline, is often not entirely clear for schools. If you do something with an iPad, is it Art &amp; Technology? And what if you draw a picture of the future? And how about Maker Education, is that Art &amp; Technology too?
Art &amp; Technology is popular, with many initiatives picking up on this, making the discipline diffuse. For example, we see activities where participants follow a step-by-step plan promoted as Art &amp; Technology, while no participants' own thinking or creativity is encouraged.</p>
<p>Art &amp; Technology is challenging to capture in one definition. Together with several cultural institutions in Eindhoven, we developed indicators to identify educational activities within this art discipline, categorized into four approaches.</p>
<p><strong><em>Technology is used within an activity:</em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>as a tool or medium.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>to reflect on society and current topics.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>to stimulate a critical, open attitude.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>to incite wondering and dreaming.</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In these rapidly changing times filled with crises, it is more crucial than ever for young people to stay aware of technology&rsquo;s potential and drawbacks. Empowering them to explore their beliefs and aspirations is essential, allowing them to take charge of their future and experience the belief that they can shape it. Encouraging them to understand and coexist with differenct opinions while being open to adjusting their own through new experiences is also vital. We should provide the younger generation with skills - including creative, critical thinking and research - that will enable them to take charge of today&rsquo;s technologies and the distant future. And, not to forget, have fun doing so. According to STRP, this attitude and mentality are increasingly essential to sustain oneself in our rapidly changing world and to achieve an healty and undivided society.</p>

<p>How media art (particularly what is called new media art, but may include art of any medium, broadly speaking) is intercepted and used to communicate, create connections, engage in collaborative activities.
The MMA is the also the name of the collective project working to understand and explore the issues as well as new possibilities of mediating media arts (the above) through interdisciplinary perspectives.</p>

<p>Hello, I’m Youjin Jeon from Seoul, working as a composer and media artist, and now I’m running a community called WOMAN OPEN TECH LAB.</p>
<h4 id="how-would-you-define-mediating-media-arts--media-art-mediation">How would you define mediating media arts / media art mediation?</h4>
<p>Our society is kind of obsessed with learning and presenting new, emerging, cutting-edge technologies. Mediation is an attempt to overcome or bypass the many problems and limitations of the existing educational process. It not only helps people build technology literacy, but it also helps them respect their autonomy and form individual perspectives of technology.</p>
<h4 id="what-specific-issues-and-concerns-do-you-have-in-the-field-of-education-and-technology">What specific issues and concerns do you have in the field of education and technology?</h4>
<p>As media arts expands, at the same time, the lack or diversity is seen in many ways. I pay attention to the deepening of existing inequality due to technology. Technology is what makes human life progress, but it also generate problems and discomfort that did not exist. WOMAN OPEN TECH LAB develops pedagogies that encompass the multifacetedness of technologies and bridge the gap.</p>

<p>I am Min-hyung kang, living and working in South Korea, temporarily staying in Berlin now for my curatorial fellowship.</p>
<h4 id="how-would-you-define-mediating-media-arts--media-art-mediation">How would you define mediating media arts / media art mediation?</h4>
<p>When media becomes a powerful tool beyond its original definition of <strong>mediating</strong>, there comes a series of consequences that we need to take a look. It is merely an artistic tool now, and definition must be made from revisiting conventional media art in a political, socioenonomicanol, historical and communal way.</p>
<h4 id="what-specific-issues-and-concerns-do-you-have-in-the-field-of-education-and-technology">What specific issues and concerns do you have in the field of education and technology?</h4>
<p>Education tends to set a goal whichever that is, and most of the time, it can directly connect to a sense of achievement. Since we are so used to this achievement and fulfillment, the education related to technology also easily falls into this. However, I believe the recent technology including capitalism, speed, and effectiveness blinds us in a way that it works for its best, thus the education can only offer an opportunity to look at the behind of the tech scene.</p>
